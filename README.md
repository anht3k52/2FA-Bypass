## Bypass Techniques

### 1. Flawed Two-Factor Verification Logic
- **Summary**: Flawed logic allows attackers to manipulate cookies or session variables after the first authentication step to access another user's account.
- **Example**: Manipulating the `account` cookie to impersonate a victim after the first login step.

### 2. Clickjacking on 2FA Disable Feature
- **Summary**: Using iframes and social engineering to trick the victim into disabling their own 2FA settings.
- **Key Steps**: 
   - Iframe the 2FA disable page.
   - Exploit user interaction through social engineering.

### 3. Response Manipulation
- **Summary**: Modifying server response values to trick the system into accepting an unsuccessful 2FA attempt.
- **Example**: Change `success: false` to `success: true` in the response payload.

### 4. Status Code Manipulation
- **Summary**: Changing the HTTP status code to bypass security checks.
- **Example**: Modify a `4xx` error code to `200 OK` to bypass 2FA.

### 5. 2FA Code Reusability
- **Summary**: Reusing old 2FA codes to bypass checks.
- **Key Steps**: Test code reusability over multiple sessions and across longer durations.

### 6. CSRF on 2FA Disable Feature
- **Summary**: Exploiting Cross-Site Request Forgery to disable 2FA without user interaction.
- **Example**: Use existing session information to disable 2FA through CSRF attacks.

### 7. Backup Code Abuse
- **Summary**: Using brute-force and response manipulation techniques to bypass backup code checks.

### 8. 2FA Refer Check Bypass
- **Summary**: Manipulating the referer header to fool the application into skipping 2FA checks.
- **Example**: Change the referer header to a URL that appears to come from a 2FA-confirmed page.

## Misconfiguration Exploits

### 9. Lack of Brute-Force Protection
- **Summary**: The absence of rate-limiting allows unlimited attempts to brute-force the 2FA code.
- **Example**: Repeatedly sending 2FA code requests or brute-forcing code input fields.

### 10. Missing 2FA Code Integrity Validation
- **Summary**: Using a valid 2FA code from another account to bypass the victim's 2FA.

### 11. Password Reset/Email Change - 2FA Disable
- **Summary**: Exploiting password reset or email change functions to bypass or disable 2FA.

### 12. Re-sending Code and Reset Limit
- **Summary**: Resetting the brute-force limit by resending the same code repeatedly.

### 13. Leaked Token
- **Summary**: Identifying tokens that are inadvertently leaked in the response or logs.

### 14. Infinite OTP Regeneration
- **Summary**: Generating OTPs indefinitely until one matches the required code.

### 15. Subdomain Vulnerabilities
- **Summary**: Using outdated or vulnerable subdomains to bypass modern 2FA systems.

## Advanced Bypass Techniques

### 16. Session Permission Attack
- **Summary**: Exploiting session vulnerabilities to pass 2FA checks on a victim's account using attacker session data.

### 17. Guessable Cookie Exploitation
- **Summary**: Exploiting weak cookie structures used in "remember me" features to bypass 2FA.
